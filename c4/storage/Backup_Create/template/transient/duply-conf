# gpg encryption settings, simple settings:
#  GPG_KEY='disabled' - disables encryption alltogether
#  GPG_KEY='<key1>[,<key2>]'; GPG_PW='pass' - encrypt with keys, sign 
#    with key1 if secret key available and use GPG_PW for sign & decrypt
#  GPG_PW='passphrase' - symmetric encryption using passphrase only
GPG_KEY='[-GPG_KEY_BACKUP_PUBLIC-]'
GPG_KEY_SIGN='[-GPG_KEY_BACKUP_PRIVATE-]'
GPG_PW='[-GPG_PASSWORD_BACKUP-]'
GPG_PW_SIGN='[-GPG_PASSWORD_BACKUP-]'
# gpg encryption settings in detail (extended settings)
#  the above settings translate to the following more specific settings
#  GPG_KEYS_ENC='<keyid1>,[<keyid2>,...]' - list of pubkeys to encrypt to
#  GPG_KEY_SIGN='<keyid1>|disabled' - a secret key for signing
#  GPG_PW='<passphrase>' - needed for signing, decryption and symmetric
#   encryption. If you want to deliver different passphrases for e.g. 
#   several keys or symmetric encryption plus key signing you can use
#   gpg-agent. Add '--use-agent' to the duplicity parameters below.
#   also see "A NOTE ON SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION AND SIGNING" in duplicity manpage
# notes on en/decryption
#  private key and passphrase will only be needed for decryption or signing.
#  decryption happens on restore and incrementals (compare archdir contents).
#  for security reasons it makes sense to separate the signing key from the
#  encryption keys. https://answers.launchpad.net/duplicity/+question/107216
#GPG_KEYS_ENC='<pubkey1>,<pubkey2>,...'
#GPG_KEY_SIGN='<prvkey>'
# set if signing key passphrase differs from encryption (key) passphrase
# NOTE: available since duplicity 0.6.14, translates to SIGN_PASSPHRASE
